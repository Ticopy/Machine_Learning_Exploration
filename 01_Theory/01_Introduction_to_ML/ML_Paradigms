Main types of ML paradigms :
  - Supervised Learning
  - Unsupervised Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning

SUPERVISED LEARNING :
  From a learning set S = {(xi,yi)} i from 1 to m
  find a underlying dependency :
      * In the form of a function h as close as possible to f (target function) yi = f(xi)
      * Or in the form of a probability distribution P(xi,yi)
  in order to make predictions about future (unknown) x
  
  If f is a continuous function : Regression, Density estimation
  If f is a discrete function : Classification
  If f is a binary function (boolean) : Concept learning

UNSUPERVISED LEARNING :
  From the learning set S = {(xi)} i from 1 to m
  find underlying regularities of the whole set
  in order to summarize, suggesting regularities, understand...

REINFORCEMENT LEARNING :
  The learning data are a sequence of perceptions, actions and rewards (st,at,rt) t from 1 to infinity
  with a reinforcement rt that can be related to past actions made far before t
